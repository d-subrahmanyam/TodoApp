# TodoApp
A Simple TodoApp built on OSGi technologies.

As a part of my OSGi learning I wanted to experiment with OSGi and build a TodoApp. 

The TodoApp would have the following features/modules - 
- A Simple UI to 
  - Manage User Creation, Login and Logout.
  - CRUD the Todo items. 
  - User sessions. 
  - Security
  - Modern UI with support for CSS, JS, HTML, AJAX. 
- Todo Service Abstraction 
- Todo Service Implementation in various formats
  - In-memory
  - In-memory DB (H2 DB)
  - Embedded DB (Orient DB)
  - MySql
  - Mongo DB
- User session management
  - In-memory
